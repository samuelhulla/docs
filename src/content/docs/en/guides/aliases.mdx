An **alias** is a way to create shortcuts for your imports.

Aliases can help improve the development experience in codebases with many directories or relative imports.

```astro title="src/pages/about/company.astro" del="../../components" del="../../assets"
---
import Button from '../../components/controls/Button.astro';
import logoUrl from '../../assets/logo.png?url';
---
```

In this example, a developer would need to understand the tree relationship between `src/pages/about/company.astro`, `src/components/controls/Button.astro`, and `src/assets/logo.png`. And then, if the `company.astro` file were to be moved, these imports would also need to be updated.

You can add import aliases from either `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`.

```json title="tsconfig.json" ins={5-6}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@assets/*": ["src/assets/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
Make sure `compilerOptions.baseUrl` is set so the aliased paths can be resolved.
:::

The development server will automatically restart after this configuration change. You can now import using the aliases anywhere in your project:

```astro title="src/pages/about/company.astro" ins="@components" ins="@assets"
---
import Button from '@components/controls/Button.astro';
import logoUrl from '@assets/logo.png?url';
---
```

These aliases are also integrated automatically into [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) and other editors.

### Integrating with Deployment Services

When using path aliases, it is likely that your deployment __will not work__ out of the box without further configuration.

:::note
This is not an `astro` related issue. However, since we rely on `vite` to produce builds of your websites, further configuration is needed to support aliases. For more details, please check `vite`'s [alias resolution](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options#resolve-alias) configuration.
:::

To resolve this issue, add the following fields to your Astro configuration:

```mjs title="astro.config.mjs" ins={1} ins={4-13}
import { path } from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        // Your aliases should mirror the ones defined in your tsconfig.json
        // mirroring the structure defined above, it would look like: 
        "@components": path.resolve(path.dirname(''), './src/components'),
        "@assets": path.resolve(path.dirname(''), './src/assets'),
      }
    }
  }
})
